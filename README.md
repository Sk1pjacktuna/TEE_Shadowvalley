# THEE research practical October - December 2024
Authors: Balz Fuchs, Florin Suter, Felix Rentschler

This is the finalized repository of the THEE research practical. 
# Biological questions
- How does migration of a deleterious genotype influence extinction probability of a diploid population?
- How big is the probability for a diploid population to be rescued with migration of a maladaptive genotype?


# Contents
The folder "Final Project" contains the finalized project:
 - Final_code_all_inclusive.Rmd = Version of the code, knittable from any device that can run r
 - Final_code_all_inclusive.nb.html = HTML version of "Final_code_all_inclusive.Rmd"
 - Report_researchpractical_THEE.docx = The paper outining methods, results, and conclusions
 - Data_2000_reps_from_everything.csv = An excel table containing the generated data with different fitnesses (0.9 & 1.1) for the heterozygote
 - eva_data_slay.csv = Excel table containing second set of generated data for 3-7 migrants per generation to try to explain anomaly seen in graph (explained in report)

The folder "Images" contains some screenshots of data and a sketch of the model

The rest of the files are a combination of earlier projects that were later discarded (shadowvalley, sesons model) and r script of the final model. These files are not important for the generation or visualization of the data as these files are found in the "Final Project" folder.

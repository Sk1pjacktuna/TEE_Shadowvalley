# THEE research practical October - December 2024
Authors: Balz Fuchs, Florin Suter, Felix Rentschler

This is the finalized repository of the THEE research practical. 
# Biological questions
- How does migration of a deleterious genotype influence extinction probability of a diploid population?
- How big is the probability for a diploid population to be rescued with migration of a maladaptive genotype?


# Contents
The folder "Final Project" contains the finalized project:
 - Final_code_all_inclusive.Rmd = Version of the code, knittable from any device that can run r
 - Final_code_all_inclusive.nb.html = HTML version of "Final_code_all_inclusive.Rmd"
 - Report_researchpractical_THEE.docx = The paper outining methods, results, and conclusions
 - Data_2000_reps_from_everything.csv = An excel table containing the generated data with different fitnesses (0.9 & 1.1) for the heterozygote
 - eva_data_slay.csv = Excel table containing second set of generated data for 3-7 migrants per generation to try to explain anomaly seen in graph (explained in report)

"Images" = screenshots/ PDfs of data visualizations as well as a sketch of an outdated model

"Data analysis precursors" =   outdated/ incomplete versions of the finalized code as well as additional codes for visualizations that are not included in the final report.

"Data tables" = .csv files that contain all the generated data

"Discarded ideas" = code, concepts, and data of discarded model ideas

"miscellaneous" = files that do not belong in the repository but we are unsure if it is okay to delete them
